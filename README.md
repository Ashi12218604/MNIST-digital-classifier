# MNIST-digital-classifier
**Overview**
This project is a digital classifier for the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits (0-9). The classifier is implemented using both Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), achieving **98%** accuracy.

**Features**
Logistic Regression: Basic classifier for digit recognition.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Advanced classifier with improved accuracy.
High Accuracy: Achieved 98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language for implementation.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation.
Matplotlib: Library for data visualization.
TensorFlow/Keras: Library for building and training machine learning models.
Google Colab: Platform used for running the code and experiments.

**Usage**
Upload the notebook to Google Colab:
Open Google Colab and upload the notebook file (mnist_classifier.ipynb).
Run the Logistic Regression Model:
Execute the cells corresponding to the Logistic Regression implementation in the Colab notebook.

**Run the CNN Model:**
Execute the cells corresponding to the CNN implementation in the Colab notebook.

**View Results:**
Results and performance metrics will be displayed in the output cells of the Colab notebook.
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is included in the Colab notebook. For more information about the dataset, visit MNIST Database.

**Results**
Logistic Regression Accuracy: X% (Replace with actual accuracy)
CNN Accuracy: 98%
